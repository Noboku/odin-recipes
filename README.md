# odin-recipes

This is a simple HTML recipe page meant to demonstrate my HTML knowledge gained through The Odin Project.

Disclaimer: I already have sufficient HTML, CSS, and Javascript knowledge. This is just a means for me to go through The Odin Project from start to finish and have the ability to say that I have completed it.
