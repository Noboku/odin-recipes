    <h3>White, creamy, and a rich smooth Italian dish.</h3>

    <p>
      Fettuccine Alfredo, or fettuccine al burro ("fettuccine with butter") is
      an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan
      cheese. As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth
      and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta. The dish became widespread and
      eventually spread to the United States, where it remains popular. It has
      its reasons for its explosive popularity, because it's so darn delicious!
