    <h3>The classic Italian dessert.</h3>

    <p>
      One of Italy's most popular, Tiramisu is a rich treat, an elegant and rich
      layered Italian dessert with diverse ingredients. The name itself,
      tiramisu, means “pick me up” in Italian most likely referring to the two
      caffeinated ingredients that are present in the dish, espresso and cocoa.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar, divided</li>
      <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese</li>
      <li>6 egg whites, stiffly beaten</li>
      <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons kirschwasser</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups strong brewed coffee, cold</li>
      <li>25 ladyfingers</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl beat together the egg yolks and 1/3 cup of sugar. Using
        a wooden spoon stir in mascarpone cheese, beaten egg whites, cream and
        kirschwasser; stir until smooth. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dissolve remaining 2/3 cup sugar in coffee. Quickly, to avoid complete
        saturation, dip ends of ladyfingers in coffee mixture. Place ladyfingers
        in a single layer in a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish. Spread a layer of
        cheese mixture over the ladyfingers; repeat layers, ending with cheese
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and refrigerate for several hours. Sprinkle with cocoa just before
        serving.
